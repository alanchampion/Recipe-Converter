If you would like it a little less diluted, put the clarified cocktail in the fridge before serving.\n\nhttps://drinkinghobby.com/clarified-jungle-bird/","title":"Clarified Jungle Bird","userEditedTimestampUsec":1582817661300000,"labels":[{"name":"Drinks"},{"name":"Bitter"},{"name":"Tiki"},{"name":"Spirit Forward"},{"name":"Dinner"}]}
