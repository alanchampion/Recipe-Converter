A month would be better, and two better still. In fact, there\u2019s nothing that says you couldn\u2019t age it a year, but I\u2019ve just never been able to wait that long. (And yes, you can also drink it right away.)\nServe in mugs or cups topped with a little extra nutmeg grated right on top.\n\nhttps://altonbrown.com/eggnog-recipe/","title":"Aged Eggnog","userEditedTimestampUsec":1572901820867000,"labels":[{"name":"Drinks"},{"name":"Sweet"},{"name":"Group"},{"name":"Dinner"},{"name":"Dessert"}]}
